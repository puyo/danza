# Danza

Programming exercise based on Crypt of the Necrodancer, hacked at Rails Camp
Gold Coast 2016.

The idea is that you get together and run the server on a projector or TV with
the volume cranked and then all write your own clients to connect to it and
attempt to get the most points using your programming prowess.

You might notice there are no music files. I removed them because I never asked
for the permission to include them in the repo. If you have some sweet free
dance music you want to contribute, let me know.

You'll have to edit the appropriate music/*.yml file and set the BPM correctly
(trial and error is how I did it).
